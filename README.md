# Charlie

### Charlie is a command line utility which transpiles a markup language custom made for note taking to well styled html for studying and viewing.


Charlie's markup language, in addition to allowing you to write in an indentation based, hierarchical manner, gives you the ability to specify
certain lines as events, people, dates, and places.
